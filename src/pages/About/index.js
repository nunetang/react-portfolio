            Hello there! Thanks for reading my bio. I am a former QA Engineer and Math teacher with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science degree, majored in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, who is attending a full stack web development bootcamp at the University of Washington and am interested in shifting my career focus to software development. I have hard (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, MySQL, MongoDB) and soft skills (communication, teamwork, adaptability, problem-solving). I love to challenge myself and I am doing so in UW's Coding Bootcamp. I am currently seeking a diverse professional home in which to collaborate on technologies that will enrich the lives of others. On my off time I enjoy yoga, going to the gym, traveling and seeing obscure bands at small venues. I am very excited to see where this Bootcamp takes me!
